			Hello! This section will show you how to install your login system. First of all, you should keep this page up, and then (if this system isn't already uploaded) upload this system onto your website. Then you should go to the install.php file on your site in a new window/tab. While you read the <em>Install</em> section, the actual system should not be installed, as it acts as a walk-through.<br />
			<blockquote>
				<h1 class="headertxt"><a name="install_db">Database</a></h1><br />
				Setting up your database is quite easy. Fill in the necessary fields, the <em>port</em> field does not need to be filled in unless you know you must, if you have no idea what it is for, don't try to fill it in. When the installation is complete, you will be asked to download a file called <em>config.php</em> please download it and upload it into the <em>/includes</em> directory. If you ever need to change your database settings, they will be stored in there. Remember keep the <em>install.php</em> file opened in the other browser while you read this section.
			</blockquote>
			
			<blockquote>
				<h1 class="headertxt"><a name="install_file">Files/Directories</a></h1><br />
				It will be necessary for you to <em>chmod</em> certain files and directories so they will work properly. The <em>/templates</em> directory should be chmoded to <em>666</em> and the <em>/compiled</em> directory should be chmoded to <em>771</em>. Now you can go into the <em>/language/en</em> folder and chmod the file <em>en_register_email.txt</em> and <em>en_profile_email.txt</em> to <em>755</em>. Remember keep the <em>install.php</em> file opened in the other browser while you read this section.
			</blockquote>
			
			<blockquote>
				<h1 class="headertxt"><a name="install_other">Other Options</a></h1><br />
				First should be the cookie settings. These aren't just for cookies, they are for sessions also so don't ignore them, or your login system won't work.
				<ul>
					<li>The <em>cookie prefix</em> field will allow all the cookies/sessions set by your site to have a prefix, so they don't clash with other cookies/sessions.</li>
					<li>The <em>cookie secure</em> field will allow the cookies you set to be secure, this will only work if you use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSL" title="SSL - Wikipedia" target="_blank" class="inline" style="cursor: help;">SSL</a> (e.g. your site starts with <em>https://</em> instead of <em>http://</em>).</li>
					<li>The <em>cookie path</em> field sets the path to which the cookie can be read from, if you want your entire site to be able to read them, put <em>/</em> if you want just the directory that holds the login pages, put something like this <em>/login_directory</em>.</li>
					<li>The <em>cookie expiration</em> is how long cookies will last before they expire (in seconds), which means the user <u>could</u> be logged out. If you want them always to be logged in, just put <em>31449600</em> (one year) in the field.</li>
					<li>The <em>cookie domain</em> is the domain to which the cookie is being set, no <em>http://</em> or <em>www</em> is needed. If you want subdomains to be able to read your cookies, you must put a dot ( . ) before it (e.g. <em>.example.com</em>).</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				Next should be some login settings.
				<ul>
					<li>The <em>require activation</em> determines whether or not you want the users to activate their accounts before logging in.</li>
					<li>The <em>max login attempts</em> is how many times a user can login before not being able to for 12 hours (this is for security for trying to stop people to crack accounts). The default value is <em>5</em>.</li>
					<li>The <em>login redirect</em> is the page location of which the user will be redirected on a successful login, it can be a URL (e.g. <em>http://www.example.com/page.php</em>) or relative to the current directory (e.g. <em>index.php</em>).</li>
					<li>The <em>logout redirect</em> is the page location of which the user will be redirected on a successful logout. It can be a URL (e.g. <em>http://www.example.com/page.php</em>) or relative to the current directory (e.g. <em>index.php</em>).</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				Now there are just some misc. options, which are each explained below.
				<ul>
					<li>The <em>template directory</em> is the directory of which the templates are stored, the default is <em>templates</em>, and it only needs to be changed if that directory is renamed.</li>
					<li>The <em>compiled directory</em> is the directory of which the compiled templates are stored, the default is <em>compiled</em>, and it only needs to be changed if that directory is renamed.</li>
					<li>The <em>auth guest profile</em> field is to determine whether guests can view member profiles or not.</li>
					<li>The <em>default template</em> field is the template directory of the current template installed, it should be <em>default</em> as that is the default template given by me. But it can be changed later when you install more.</li>
					<li>The <em>max about you</em> field is the maximum length a user's <em>about you</em> section of their profile can be. This should be no higher than 20000.</li>
					<li>The <em>auth profile image</em> field is the field to determine whether your users can place an offsite image onto their profile.</li>
					<li>The <em>password complexity (numbers)</em> field lets you decide whether or not users must have at least 1 number in their password.</li>
					<li>The <em>password complexity (special characters)</em> field lets you decide whether or not users must have at least 1 special character in their password.</li>
					<li>The <em>language</em> field lets you decide what language the system will use, it can be changed but most likely won't.</li>
					<li>The <em>site name</em> field is so you can put in a name for your site, that will be included in emails sent by the site so people who registered/recieve mail know who it is from.</li>
					<li>The <em>email signature</em> field is so you can put a signature at the end of each email sent out by the site.</li>
					<li>The <em>from email</em> is the email address you want users to see when they recieve email from you.</li>
					<li>The <em>gzip</em> field is to see whether or not you want <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip" title="GZIP - Wikipedia" class="inline" target="_blank" style="cursor: help;">GZIP Compression</a> enabled for your site. GZIP Compression can speed up the output of HTML by your site as it compresses the page. The option will not show if the <em>zlib</em> library is not found on your server - sorry.</li>
				</ul>

			<h1 class="headertxt"><a name="configure">Configuration</a></h1><br />
			This section will show you how to configure these files so they work the way you want them to. First I will show you how to set up members only pages.
			<blockquote>
				<h1 class="headertxt"><a name="configure_memberonly">Members Only</a></h1><br />
				So you want to know how to setup a members only page eh? This section is for you then. First of all, you will need to open the following files:<br />
				<ul>
					<li><em>/layout.php</em></li>
					<li><em>/includes/header.php</em></li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				Okay, open the first file in a text editor. Make sure you use an editor that supports LF endings. You can tell if yours doesn't as boxes will appear all over the place. If you use Windows, I can suggest <a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html" class="inline" title="Notepad2" target="_blank" style="cursor: help;">Notepad2</a>, it is what I use to code all my products. Anyway moving on once you are in this file, you will notice it is mostly blank. You should see a piece of code like this:<br /><br />
				<code>/* Look in the header.php file for the next page number so you can define the title */<br />
				define('PAGE', 7);<br />
				include_once('includes/header.php');<br />
				<br />
				include_once('includes/footer.php');</code><br /><br />
				You should notice there is a space between the first and second include. This is where our code will go. Put this code in to determine whether the user is logged in or not:<br /><br />
				<code>if ($is_logged) {<br />
				?&gt;<br />
				<br />
				&lt;?php<br />
				exit;<br />
				}<br />
				else {<br />
				$tmpl-&gt;display('not_logged.qtmpl');<br />
				}</code><br /><br />
				Now in this same file (with new content added) right below <em>define('IN_LOGIN_SYS', true);</em> you should put this code:<br /><br />
				<code>define('HEADER', false);<br />
				define('GUEST', true);</code><br /><br />
				This will stop the header made by me to be output if the user is logged in, allowing you to make the HTML custom to your own site. It will also make sure the header is output if the user is a guest, to keep the login system intact. If you want to build onto the current layout, you must remove the <em>exit;</em> command, and then change <em>define('HEADER', false);</em> to <em>define('HEADER', true);</em>. Now we can define the page title (if you are using the already made layout). You should see the line <em>define('PAGE', 7);</em>, this is where the admin.php file comes into play. In the admin.php file down bottom, you will see a list of page numbers with there titles, all you have to do is add onto it, like so:<br /><br />
				<code>case 8:<br />
				$page_title = 'My Custom Member Page';<br />
				break;</code><br /><br />
				Now save the admin.php file and upload it. Now you can add your HTML to this file, that will go between <em>?&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;?php</em>. Now you can save this file as <em>mynewpage.php</em> in the same directory as the other files. After uploading it, it should work fine.<br /><br />

				@TODO ACTUALLY MAKE A GUIDE FOR KNOW PLEASE ASK AN ADVANCED PROGRAMMER TO HELP YOU :)
				<br />
				<h1 class="headertxt"><a name="configure_template">Install a new Template</a></h1><br />
				This is a fairly simple task. To install a new template, all you have to do is upload the and then use the admin control panel to configure the new template :)<br />
				<h1 class="headertxt"><a name="configure_language">Install a new Language</a></h1><br />
				This like the installing a new template is a really easy task. Just upload the language into the language directory, and then go into your admin control panel (settings) and then type in your new language directory name :)</blockquote>
